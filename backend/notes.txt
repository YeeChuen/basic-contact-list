Flask-SQLAlchemy is an ORM (Object Relational Mapping)
    --> allow us to connect to a SQL database,
        and map the entries and sequel into a Python object,
        so we can operate on these objet easier

flask-cors
    --> allow us to have cross origin request
    --> for example (JS request --> Python or Python request --> JS)
